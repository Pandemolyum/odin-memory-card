# odin-memory-card

A simple memory game where the player must score points by clicking on as many cards (movie posters) as possible without selecting the same card twice within the same game.

The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://odin-memory-card-dby.pages.dev/).

## Credits

Credits go to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) whose free API was used to generate all movie poster images.
